# Test Responses Configuration for Simple Rails Template
# This file defines automatic responses to interactive prompts during testing
#
# Format:
#   "prompt_pattern": "response"
#
# Patterns can be:
#   - Simple strings (will be escaped): "Add authentication with Devise?"
#   - Regex patterns (wrap in /): "/Add.*authentication.*\?/"
#
# Responses should be the exact text you would type, without quotes

# Simple template specific prompts
"Add authentication with Devise? (y/n)": "n"
"Add Bootstrap for styling? (y/n)": "n"
"Setup RSpec for testing? (y/n)": "n"
"Initialize git repository? (y/n)": "n"
"Load seed data? (y/n)": "n"

# File conflict prompts (always overwrite in tests)
"/Overwrite.*\\? \\(enter \"h\" for help\\) \\[Ynaqdhm\\]/": "y"
"/conflict.*Overwrite.*\\[Ynaqdhm\\]/": "y"

# Generic fallbacks
"/\\? \\(y\\/n\\)/": "n"
"/\\? \\(yes\\/no\\)/": "no"
